Washington, D.C. serves as the political hub of the country, housing the three branches of the federal government: the Executive, led by the President; the Legislative, consisting of the Congress; and the Judicial, headed by the Supreme Court. Additionally, it is home to numerous national monuments and museums, primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city plays a pivotal role in the nation's history and governance, making it a significant location not only for its political importance but also for its cultural and historical heritage.\",\n",
